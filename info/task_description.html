    <i> Find the greatest product of n (the 2nd argument) in a consecutive series for the given list l (the 1st
        argument). For example: given n=2 and l=[1,2,3,5,1,6,1], the corresponding consecutive series are [1,2], [2,3],
        [3,5], [5,1], [1,6], [6,1], their products are 2, 6, 15, 5, 6, 6. The final result is 15.

    <i>There is no catch at all. The list is not empty and elements in the list are positive integers. The size of the
        list might be large (around 10**6 maybe) but not super-large.</i>
