    Find the greatest product of n (the 2nd argument) consecutive increasing series in a given list l (the 1st argument). For example, given n=2 and l=[1,2,3,5,1,6,1], the corresponding consecutive increasing series are [1,2], [2,3], [3,5], their products are 2, 6, 15, then the result is 15.

    There is no catch at all. The list is non empty. The size of the list might be large (around 10**6 maybe) but not super large.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of Int and an Int.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int.
